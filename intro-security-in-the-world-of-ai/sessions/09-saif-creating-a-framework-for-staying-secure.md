🧠 At a Glance

SAIF (**Secure AI Framework**) provides a structured approach to secure AI systems. AI is reshaping both the threat landscape and the technology ecosystem. SAIF helps organizations securely adopt and deploy AI capabilities.

SAIF introduces a **four‑step process**, which leads to the application of its six core security elements.

---

## 🔐 SAIF Four-Step Process

### **Step 1 — Understand the use**

Before building or using AI, clarify:

- The **business problem** you want to solve
- The **data requirements**
- The **user experience**
- The **origin of your model outputs**

This foundational step reduces risks and aligns the AI system with business goals.

---

### **Step 2 — Assemble the team**

AI security requires cross‑functional collaboration.

**Possible team members:**

- Business use case owners
- Security & cloud engineering
- Risk & audit teams
- Privacy & legal
- Data science teams
- Development teams
- Responsible AI & Ethics teams

Each team brings expertise to ensure safety, compliance, and technical robustness.

---

### **Step 3 — Level set with an AI primer**

AI—especially generative AI—is rapidly evolving. A shared foundational understanding helps all stakeholders engage safely and effectively.

Non‑technical teams should know:

- Basics of AI
- High‑level risks
- Ethical considerations
