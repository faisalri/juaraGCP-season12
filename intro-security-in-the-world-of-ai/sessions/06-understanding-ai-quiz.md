## 📝 Question 1

Which of the following is a concern of using bad training data in an AI model?

- The model may become confident and give more vivid, human‑like responses.
- The model will not be able to generate any output.
- **✔️ The model may fail to generate accurate outputs. Bad training data can also introduce sensitive information, profanity, or unsafe content, which may appear in the model’s responses.**

A retailer uses an AI model to predict whether a customer might return an item. Which statement best captures an important data‑related concern?

- The model requires extremely large amounts of data to work.
- The model is not trustworthy due to training speed.
- **✔️ If certain groups are under‑represented in training data, the model may produce biased results.**
- The model must be hard‑coded rules instead of ML.

## 📝 Question 3

You’re building a mobile app that uses AI to analyze photos and suggest hashtags. What’s the most likely integration approach?

- Build your own model from scratch.
- **✔️ Use an existing image‑recognition API that provides hashtag suggestions.**
