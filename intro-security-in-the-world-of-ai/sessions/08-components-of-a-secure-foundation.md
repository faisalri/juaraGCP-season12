🧠 At a Glance

AI is more than a model — it is an interconnected system composed of **four core components**:

- **Application**
- **Model**
- **Data**
- **Infrastructure**

These components form the foundation of an AI system and must be secured holistically.

## 🔐 Security Across the Four Components

Security themes overlap because AI systems are interconnected. Controls must be applied at multiple layers.

---

### ▶️ Application Component

- Follow AI model **rules & limitations** — prevent harmful or disallowed inputs.
- Filter user inputs before they reach the model.
- Handle model outputs responsibly; consider ethical and safety implications.

---

### ▶️ Infrastructure Component

- Secure the hardware/software environment where the model runs.
- Implement granular access control.
- Protect the model from tampering or unauthorized modification.

---

### ▶️ Model Component

- Consider sensitive data your model may handle.
- Prevent outputs that infer protected attributes (gender, race, etc.).
- Evaluate ethical implications of outputs.

---

### ▶️ Data Component

- Follow proper regulations.
- Ensure user consent where applicable.
- Handle PII securely (masking, redaction, encryption).
