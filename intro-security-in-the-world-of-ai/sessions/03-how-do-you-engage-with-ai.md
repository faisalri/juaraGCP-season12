## 🧠 At a Glance

- In practice, you rarely interact with the raw AI model directly; you go through **applications** or **APIs**.
- Applications are the bridge between users and models: they gather input, call the model, and present outputs.
- There are **three primary ways** to engage with AI: **build models**, **build apps/APIs that use models**, and **use AI‑powered apps**.
- Security responsibilities differ by engagement type.

## 🔐 Key Concepts

### What is an API?

An **API** is a software interface that lets different applications talk to each other and reuse capabilities without exposing internal details. Teams often integrate AI via language/vision/speech APIs.

### What is an application?

An **application** is user‑facing software that solves a task. Many apps embed AI behind the scenes and provide UI for inputs/outputs.

### Three ways to engage with AI

1. **Build AI models** — create new models or customize fine‑tuned ones.
2. **Build applications or APIs that leverage AI models** — integrate model capabilities into software.
3. **Use AI‑powered applications or APIs** — consume existing tools and services.

> 🔏 **Security note:** If you **build models/apps**, you control security posture end‑to‑end (and own the risks). If you **use** third‑party AI apps, assess the provider's controls and be deliberate about what data you share.

## 📝 Quick Check — Understanding input data

**Question:** When using an AI application, providing input data is similar to:

- **✔️ Filling out a form on a website. (Correct)**
- Solving a complex mathematical equation.
- Reading a book.
- Watching a movie.

## ✅ Action Items

- Classify your current AI engagement type (build vs. integrate vs. use).
- Map corresponding security responsibilities and data‑handling rules.
- Document API providers used and review their security posture.
