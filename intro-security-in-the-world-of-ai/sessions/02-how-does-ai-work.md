## 🧠 At a Glance

- AI is not magic; it is powered by mathematical models.
- Models take inputs (data/prompts) and generate outputs.
- Outputs vary: classification, prediction, recommendation.
- Machine learning trains models from data.
- Generative AI creates new content from learned patterns.

## 🔐 Key Concepts

### ⭐ What is an AI model?

AI uses mathematical equations to map inputs to outputs.

### ⭐ Types of outputs

- **Classification** — e.g., grouping destinations by trip type.
- **Prediction** — e.g., airline maintenance forecasting.
- **Recommendation** — e.g., food delivery suggestions.

### ⭐ How models are created (ML)

1. Start with training data.
2. Apply algorithm to learn patterns.
3. Deploy model to make predictions.

### ⭐ How models are used

1. Provide input.
2. Model produces output.

### ⭐ What is the output?

Outputs are *predictions*. Accuracy depends on use case.

### ⭐ What is generative AI?

Generative AI learns patterns from large datasets to create novel content.

Examples:

- Personalized fitness plan generator.
- Adaptive education content generator.
- Synthetic dataset generator.

## 📝 Quiz: Why did the AI misidentify?

**Question:** The model incorrectly labels a rose as a tulip. What is the most likely reason?

- **✔️ The AI model was not trained on enough images labeled as roses. (Correct)**
- AI is not capable of recognizing flowers.
- The AI model is intentionally providing incorrect answers.
- The AI model is too creative and generating novel outputs.
