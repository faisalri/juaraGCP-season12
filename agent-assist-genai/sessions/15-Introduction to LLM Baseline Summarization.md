## 🚀 Module Introduction: LLM Baseline Summarization
**LLM Baseline Summarization** is an Agent Assist feature that automatically generates a concise summary of a customer conversation. It works for **bot↔human** and **human↔human** dialogs. You can summarize using:
- A **pre‑trained LLM Baseline Summarization model** (focus of this lesson), or
- A **custom‑trained summarization model** on your own data (currently in limited preview in some environments).

## 💼 Business Value (Observed)
Organizations adopting Baseline Summarization report:
- ⏱️ **~10× faster** throughput for **unedited** summaries (e.g., 80–100s → **6–10s**)
- 📝 **3× faster** median time for **edited** summaries (**~25–30s**) vs manual writing
- 🧰 **Standardized format & tone** across agents → easier QA and reporting

## 🧱 Summary Sections (Baseline Template)
You can mix & match the following predefined sections when configuring the Baseline model:

1. **Situation** — Core of the customer’s query/concern; why they reached out.
2. **Action** — Steps the agent (or bot) took during the interaction.
3. **Resolution** — Final outcome (Yes / No / Partially resolved / N/A).
4. **Customer satisfaction** — Gauge of sentiment at end of chat (e.g., Satisfied/Unsatisfied).
5. **Reason for cancellation** — Used when a customer requests cancellation (use N/A otherwise).
6. **Entities** — Key value‑pairs extracted (product names, timeframes, IDs, etc.).

## 🧪 Quiz — LLM Baseline Summarization
**Passing score:** 80%

### Q1. What is the **primary benefit** of the Agent Assist Summarization feature?

**Choices:**
1) It reduces the time agents spend on summarizing conversations, leading to increased productivity.  
2) It summarizes previous similar conversations to assist the agent in finding a resolution quicker.  
3) It sends a summary report to the end user as a report of the interaction.  
4) It summarizes every sentence the customer speaks into a few words to speed up interactions.  

**✅ Correct Answer:** **(1) It reduces the time agents spend on summarizing conversations, leading to increased productivity.**

**Why:** Baseline Summarization focuses on **saving agent time** and **standardizing** the after‑call summary of the **current conversation**, not mining historical chats or sending reports to end users.
