## 📘 Feature Validation Checklist

### 📝 Summarization
To ensure LLM or baseline summarization works as expected:
- Evaluate a set of conversations and validate the accuracy of the summaries.
- Run summarization on 30–50 historical conversations and ask customers to rate them.
- Validate accuracy, completeness, and correctness across all summaries.
